mac-ansible
===========

This is a fork of adamchainz/mac-ansible

Getting Started
---------------

1. Install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) with the command from the site
2. `brew install pyenv`
3. `pyenv install <latest_python_version>` (Check playbook up to date)
4. Make sure pyenv's python on path (it will be after my shell settings are in place from playbook)
5. `python -m venv venv`
6. `source venv/bin/activate`
5. `pip install ansible` (always the best way to install Ansible)
6. Then `./playbook.yml`

Fork! Copy! Adapt!
